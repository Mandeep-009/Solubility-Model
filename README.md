# Brief
This is a machine learning model trained to predict solubility of various molecules based on the molecular data. Here we use pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries and we build two models based of algorithms of linear regression and random forest regression and then we visualise the result obtained from both these approaches.
